# CPP-days

This repository documents a journey through the fundamentals and advanced concepts of C++ programming, organized by days and modules. Each day focuses on a set of core C++ topics, building a strong foundation and gradually introducing more complex features of the language.

## About C++ and This Journey

C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language widely used for system/software development, game engines, and real-time applications. Through these days, we explore C++'s syntax, object-oriented programming, memory management, and advanced features, aiming to develop robust programming skills and a deep understanding of the language.

Each day in this repository represents a step forward in mastering C++. The focus is on learning by doing, with each module introducing new concepts and reinforcing previous knowledge through practical exercises.

## Compilation
Each module contains Makefiles with the following rules:
```sh
bashmake        # Compile the project
make clean  # Remove object files
make fclean # Remove object files and executable
make re     # Recompile from scratch
```

This repository is a comprehensive resource for anyone looking to learn C++ from the ground up, with each day designed to build on the previous, ensuring a solid grasp of both fundamental and advanced C++ concepts.
